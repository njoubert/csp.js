# CSP.JS

Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver

This is a library for expressing and solving constraint satisfaction problems, in pure JavaScript. Currently it only solves discrete finite-domain problems, and provides a couple of solvers. In the future I hope to support infinite-domain problems and continuous problems as well.

## Example

```js
var p = csp.DiscreteProblem();

p.addVariable("a", [1, 2, 3]);
p.addVariable("b", [4, 5, 6]);
p.addVariable("c", [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]);

p.addConstraint(["a", "b"], function (a, b) {
  return a * 2 === b;
});

p.addConstraint(["b", "c"], function (b, c) {
  return b * 2 === c;
});

var one_solution = p.getSolution();
var all_solutions = p.getSolutions();
```

## Solvers and Problems we support

Currently we support finite-domain problems, with the following solvers:

- Recursive Backtracking
- Forward-Checking (in progress)
- AC3 Arc Consistency (in progress)

## Intro to CSPs

### What is a CSP?

A Constraint Satisfaction Problem is formally defined as:

- A set of variables, `Xi ... Xn`
- Each variable has a domain of values it can take, `Di ... Dn`
- A set of constraints `Ci ... Cn` that specifies allowable combinations of values for a subset of the variables.

That is, a set of variables, with relations between the valid values of these variables.

There are multiple classes of CSPs:

- _Discrete problems_, where the values of each variable can be enumerated
- _Finite problems_, where the size of domain is finite
- _Continuous problems_, where the values of each variable is a range
- _Infinite problems_, where the domain of a variable is of infinite extent

Then there are subclasses of these:

- _Integer problems_, discrete infinite problems on the integers
- _Binary constraint problems_, where all the constraints are between two variables
- _Linear problems_, where all the constraints are linear
- _Integer Linear problems_, where all the constraints are linear and the values integers. This is the hardest kind of constraint problem.
- And many more...

### Examples of real-world CSPs

There are tons and tons of problems that can reduce to constraint satisfaction problems, and it is a rich field of study. But, here's some that everyone knows about:

- Sudoku
- Coloring maps
- Scheduling blocks of time
